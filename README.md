## Github Search Project

A React + Redux + TypeScript project for querying the github API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Instructions

Type the github username you would like to look up into the only available input, and hit the search button.  Then voila :)

Click on the 'Github Profile' link to go to the user's profile.  Click on any repo in the repos list and go to that repos page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
